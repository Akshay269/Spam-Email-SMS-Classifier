\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{1.5em}
    \item Self-powered sensors that are powered using the perpetual natural resources like solar energy shall be used.

	\item Quality sensors with better accuracy and precision, as well as ability to resist heat and harsh environmental conditions will be used in the future. The use of such sensor will measure the data with low missing values, errors and with greater stability.
	
	\item Existing database i.e. PostgreSQL used for data storage can be replaced by big data architecture to be able to meet the requirement of operations of huge amount of spatio-temporal data.
	
	
	\item The system application is limited to web browser. The system made for the visualisation of data shall be extended to the mobile application as well.
	
	\item The near-real time Pi-sensor data shall be used for modelling and finding the pattern.
	

	\item  Sensors can be made to communicate with each other through the IOT technology. This can save external network bandwidth as well as give rise to other interesting applications.
	
		\item  Distributed Computing architecture can be made to utilise the processing power of sensor devices when idle for on-device data processing and anomaly detection.
